Welcome to the 'My EMDR' app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by RMsoft and is available in the Google Play Store.

As an enthusiastic Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not developed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The only data that is created by you consists of app preferences and they are stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
RMsoft.
The Netherlands.
